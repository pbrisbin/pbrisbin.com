I have to admit something embarrassing: for the longest time I didn't use a
password manager. I had a system for creating unique passwords for each site
such that I could remember or reverse-engineer them in a few attempts. I did
(and do) trust Google with my data for the most part, so I used Chrome's
password sync. I even built my own [passphrase generator][passphrase-me] for my
more important passwords. It wasn't great, but every time I checked, there just
was no 1Password for Linux.

I don't know how I missed it, but at some point we got [`pass(1)`][pass].

I'm incredibly impressed with this tool; especially the ecosystem that's built
up around it. In this post I'll share why I like it, how I went about setting it
up, and how I currently interact with it day to day.

## My Requirements

The reason I used such poor password practices for so long was that I couldn't
find a solution that met all of the following requirements:

1. Linux support (preferably command-line)
1. Access to passwords on mobile
1. Secured against 3rd-party access

If I'm going to make the jump away from letting Google sync my passwords, it's
going to have to be to someone as data-trustworthy as Google or to a system
that's designed such that cross-device sync is through a provider with a
(mathematically provable) lack of access (i.e. built like [tarsnap][]).

`pass(1)` is a great Unix citizen. It's a few hundred lines of shell and
delegates all major functionality to other tools like `git` and `gpg`. It
accepts input on `stdin` and outputs on `stdout`. It will source other shell
scripts to extend its functionality. It has a detailed man page.

Because the passwords are stored in a git repository encrypted with PGP, they
can be synchronized in the clear through any git hosting provider and decrypted
on any device with a PGP key in the recipients list (e.g. my phone). Because PGP
supports encrypting to multiple recipients I can create a key per device and
revoke individually as needed.

## Setting It Up

I'm not going to go into step-by-step detail in this post. There are
instructions on the [project page][pass], there's a great [man-page][pass-man],
and the [browser][] and [android][] extensions have good, easy to follow
instructions. Instead, I'll just go over some of the more interesting things I
came across while migrating.
